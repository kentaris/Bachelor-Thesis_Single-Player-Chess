|23.02|Valid Move Generator (VMG)|I'm reading about PDDL and getting a better idea on how to implement chess in PDDL. I apparently need all possible states as a list in the the domain.ppdl file so I stopped reading and started to implement a python program that lists me all possible valid moves of a piece if only that piece is present on the board. I created a working terminal interface for it and calculated the possible valid moves for every piece to be able to verify my programm output. It's now 23:20 and I implemented all pieces. It seems to work properly and passes all tests. I hope I can use the outputs and don't find out that it was all for nothing. But even then... it still was fun to do.|
|24.02|FEN decoder/encoder|Today I tried to implement the PDDL Knight's tour problem but I got 0 solutions as an answer after ~10 seconds. I also tried to imlement the full chess problem with :types but not sure how to do it yet. I then realized some things that were missing which I may need later on and added some more functionality to the .py file I started doing yesterday and I also implemented a FEN notation decoder/encoder which takes one of either the FEN code or the board position as input and gives me the other. the FEN.py also has functions to get the fullmoves, halfmoves, castling rights, who's turn it is and if en passant availability. I think I should have implemented everything in C++ from the get go but not sure if I should switch now or not. I probably should. I should read more of haslum's chapter 2 so I am ready for my supervisor meeting is on monday. I didn't understand much of it the first time I went trough. I still have 37 pages to go trough carefully. I understood and tested most of the first part.|
|25.02|PDDL File Generator|In my valid move generator I forgot to take into account that the black pawns move in the opposite direction and also that they can jump 2 squares on the first move. I separated the 6 cases and made them callable by calling pawns(color,type) where 'type' can be either 'all' valid moves, only capture moves (sideways) or only forward moves. I may need that in the future for my PDDL file so I have it ready now. I also wrote a program which saves me time and gives me overview in the pddl file by editing a template PDDL file and the program then automatically inserts the lists of valid moves and so on in the correct spot.|
|26.02|Fixing|Not much noticable has been coded today. I spent about an hour fixing some minor mistakes and cleaning up my code. I also spent some time reading some PDDL instructions on the internet to get a better idea of how to implement the full chess problem in PDDL. I'm still kind of lost at this point tough.|
|27.02|FEN decoder/encoder integration|Today I integrated the FEN decoder/encoder. I can now give my PDDL File Generator a FEN code and it will translate it will translate it in a series of fitting PDDL statements that are directly inserted into the PDDL file (instead of writing them by hand). This will make it way more easy later on to define a start position and a goal (end/ mate) position by just giving a FEN Code and it will automatically generate the PDDL file for me. Boards can now also optionally be printed out in color and with unicode chess symbols to make it more appealing to the eye. I also discovered a lot of bugs and potential problems which were either fixed now or marked as a possible source of errors with a ToDo etry.|
|28.02|Meeting|Today I had the meeting with Augusto. We now have a contract set up which is pending to be signed by all|
|01.03|Knight's-Tour|I completed the knights problem. It's mostly given in the book.|
|02.03|**Two**-Knight's-Tour|I worked on the 2-knights problem but I did get 'ff: goal can be simplified to FALSE. No plan will solve it' as an answer. If I comment out the restriction that the two knights can't be on the same square at the same time then I get 'Planner found 0 plan(s) in 11.005secs.'|
