# Bachelorarbeit
The goal is to model a single-player Chess as a planning domain. We want to look into the problem of how to reach a given Chess position from an initial given position. As a first approach, one can encode this problem using PDDL. We also want to study how classical planners perform in this new domain and to implement a state-space search algorithm for this problem.
