# Bachelor Thesis
  
## Single Player Chess
<img width="150" align="right" src="Images/Terminal_Chess_UI.png" alt="FEN.py Terminal window output with FEN code 'r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R'">
  The goal is to model a single-player Chess as a planning domain. We want to look into the problem of how to reach a given Chess position from an initial given position. As a first approach, one can encode this problem using PDDL. We also want to study how classical planners perform in this new domain and to implement a state-space search algorithm for this problem.
