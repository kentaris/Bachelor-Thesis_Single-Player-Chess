- finish pddl-modeling
- run experiments
  - cluster?
- writing
- implementing own solver (domain dependent solver)
    - which language (java)
    - Steps:   
      - read fen encoding
      - transform it to initial state
      - search over that
      - implement chess moves in java with gbfs
      - come up with heuristics
        - missing pieces
        - mate
        - pieces out of place
        - pawns past position
        - etc
      - First steps:
        - implement bfsand see if for simplmle cases it works
        - change to gbfs & use priority queue
